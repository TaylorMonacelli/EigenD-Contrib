Sample And Hold Agent
=====================
    
This is a sample and hold agent developed by by Duncan Foster.

Inputs
- input signal (bounded float (-1,1) signal)
- gate signal (bounded float (-1,1) signal)

Outputs
- audio output (bounded float (-1, 1) signal)

The input signal is sampled when the gate signal transitions from negative to 
positive, and held until the next negative to positive transition.

ToDo:
-----
Add a verb for manual sample
