This is a Repo for Agents being developed by our users.
Each agent should be created in its own directory.

Rules
-----

The repo is being shared between all of our contributors,
so be nice.  Don't mess with other peoples directories
unless they give you permission.

Please try and keep master in a compilable state.  Work
in branches.  Remember that others will be pulling master
and will be anoyed if it won't compile.

When you change master, please rebase first to keep the
timeline nice and clean.  Try and make single coherent
changes.  You can use rebase -i to condense lots of 
'work in progress' changes together.

This will help Eigenlabs pull in your changes.  Eigenlabs
will be keeping a separate eigenlabs branch to release from.
If Eigenlabs makes changes, they will do it on that branch,
not on master.
